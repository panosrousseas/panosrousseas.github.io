Dr. Panagiotis Rousseas is a **Post Doctoral researcher** in the **Royal Institute of Technology (KTH)**, Stockholm Sweden working in the Division of Decision and Control Systems in the group of Prof. Dimos Dimarogonas. He received his **PhD in Robotics and Control** at the **Control Systems Laboratory of the School of Mechanical Engineering, National Technical University of Athens (NTUA)**, under the supervision of Professor **Kostas Kyriakopoulos** in 2025. He graduated with the Diploma of Mechanical Engineering from NTUA in 2020. He has visited the **Robotics Department of the University of Michigan** as a short term scholar in collaboration with Professor Dimitra Panagou.

He has worked as a Junior Researcher at NTUA for "Pathogen Contamination Emergency Response Technologies (PathoCERT)", a **European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Program**, and part of his PhD research was funded under the **4th call for Scholarships to PhD Candidates** by the Hellenic Foundation for Research and Innovation (HFRI). His PhD thesis titled *"Optimal Motion Planning for mobile robots using Reinforcement Learning"* concentrates on combining RL with control theory to extract solutions with provable guarantees of safety, convergence and optimality. He is currently  interested in safe and robust planning and control in static and dynamic environments for safety-critical systems.
